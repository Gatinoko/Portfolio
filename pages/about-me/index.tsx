				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>
					My name is Gabriel, Im 20 years old, and a software engineering
					student at Centennial College. Nice to meet you!
					<br />I started browsing the internet since I was very young, but I
					properly started my journey in the software/hardware world when I was
					about 8 years old and got my first laptop. At first, I was mostly
					interested in playing games (something I still do passionately to this
					day), but after some time I also discovered the art of graphical
					design and video editing through YouTube, which became a huge part of
					what I would do for the next couple of years. I taught myself how to
					edit images using Photoshop, post-processing on After Effects, editing
					on Sony Vegas, animation on Flash, and 3D modeling on Cinema 4D.
					<br />
					As I got older and more mature (around 13 years old), my parents gave
					me with my first proper desktop computer. This enabled me to not only{' '}
					<s>further fuel my gaming addiction</s> expand my graphical design
					skills, but it also got me started into the more technical side of
					videogames and computers as well. I learned how to make game servers,
					how to write simple scripting programs, what were JSON files, and how
					to make simple web pages using HTML and CSS.
